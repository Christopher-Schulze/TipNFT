# TipNFT: Comprehensive Technical Documentation

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the TipNFT smart contract project, covering its architecture, functionalities, setup, deployment, and testing procedures. It is intended for developers looking to understand, integrate with, or build upon the TipNFT contract.

## 1. Overview

TipNFT is a Solidity-based smart contract meticulously designed to enable users to mint unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by sending Ether (ETH) tips. These NFTs are categorized into distinct "tiers" (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) based on the tip amount. The project embodies advanced Solidity development principles, illustrates best practices in smart contract design (including security and gas optimization), and provides a high-quality, professional-grade implementation, serving as a valuable reference for understanding modern smart contract engineering.

The primary goals of this project are:
- To demonstrate robust and well-documented smart contract development practices.
- To incorporate best practices for security, gas efficiency, and code clarity.
- To ensure compatibility with established NFT standards, including ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, and ERC2981.

## 4. Environment Setup

### 3.1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)

### 3.2. Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable) and install project dependencies:
```sh
git clone <repository_url> # If applicable
cd TipNFT
npm install
```

### 3.3. Environment Variables
The project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information and network configurations. Create this file in the project root by copying `.env.example`:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, edit the `.env` file and provide the following values:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: **Required.** The private key of the Ethereum account that will deploy the contract and act as its initial owner.
  *Example: `PRIVATE_KEY="0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"`*
- `RPC_URL`: **Required.** The RPC endpoint for the Ethereum network you intend to deploy to or interact with (e.g., Sepolia testnet, or a local Hardhat network).
  *Example for Sepolia (using Infura): `RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"`*
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: **Optional.** Your Etherscan API key, used for automatic contract verification on Etherscan after deployment.
  *Example: `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"`*
- `TIER1_THRESHOLD`: **Optional.** Overrides the default wei threshold for Tier 1 NFTs if specified during deployment via the deploy script. Value should be in ETH (e.g., "0.01").
  *Example: `TIER1_THRESHOLD="0.01"`*
- `TIER2_THRESHOLD`: **Optional.** Overrides the default wei threshold for Tier 2 NFTs if specified during deployment. Value should be in ETH (e.g., "0.05").
  *Example: `TIER2_THRESHOLD="0.05"`*

**Full Example `.env` content:**
```
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_infura_project_id"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your_etherscan_api_key"
TIER1_THRESHOLD="0.01" # Equivalent to 10000000000000000 wei
TIER2_THRESHOLD="0.05" # Equivalent to 50000000000000000 wei
```

## 5. Development Workflow

### 4.1. Compilation
Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```
This command compiles the Solidity files in the `contracts/` directory and generates artifacts in the `artifacts/` directory. Compilation also occurs automatically before running tests or deployment if changes are detected.

### 4.2. Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and correctness of the `TipNFT` smart contract. Tests are written using Hardhat, ethers.js, and Chai.

**To run all tests:**
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
Alternatively, use the npm script:
```sh
npm test
```

#### Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy aims for high coverage of all critical functionalities, edge cases, and security aspects of the `TipNFT` contract. Tests are organized into:
- [`test/TipNFT.test.js`](TipNFT/test/TipNFT.test.js:0): Covers core logic, ERC721Enumerable features, access control, pausable, royalties, and administrative functions.
- [`test/Reentrancy.test.js`](TipNFT/test/Reentrancy.test.js:0): Specifically tests the reentrancy protection mechanisms.

**Key areas covered by the tests include:**

- **Core Minting Logic:**
    - Minting NFTs for each tier (Tier1, Tier2, Tier3) based on various tip amounts.
    - Correct assignment of sequential token IDs (starting from 0).
    - Verification of token ownership (`ownerOf`) and balance (`balanceOf`) after minting.
    - Rejection of tips with zero value (expecting `NoTipSent` error).
    - Successful minting via both the `tip()` function and the `receive()` fallback function.
- **Tier Thresholds Management:**
    - Functionality of `setTierThresholds()` by the owner.
    - Correct tier assignment after threshold updates.
    - Rejection of invalid threshold settings (e.g., tier1 threshold >= tier2 threshold, or tier1 threshold = 0), expecting `InvalidThresholds`.
- **Metadata (Base URIs and Token URI):**
    - Owner's ability to set base URIs for different tiers via `setBaseURI()`.
    - Correct generation of `tokenURI()` by concatenating the tier-specific base URI and the token ID.
    - `tokenURI()` returns an empty string if the base URI for a token's tier is not set.
    - `tokenURI()` reverts with `ERC721NonexistentToken` if called for a non-existent token ID.
- **`ERC721Enumerable` Standard Functionality:**
    - `totalSupply()`: Verifies the correct total number of minted tokens.
    - `tokenByIndex()`: Retrieves token IDs by their global index and checks for correct ID mapping.
    - `tokenOfOwnerByIndex()`: Retrieves token IDs owned by a specific address by their owner-specific index.
    - `getOwnedTokens()`: Custom function that returns the correct list of token IDs for an owner, including an empty list for an owner with no tokens.
    - Boundary Conditions: Tests for `ERC721OutOfBoundsIndex` error when `tokenByIndex()` or `tokenOfOwnerByIndex()` are called with an out-of-bounds index.
- **Ownership and Access Control (`Ownable`):**
    - Verification that owner-restricted functions (e.g., `setBaseURI`, `setTierThresholds`, `setRoyalty`, `pause`, `unpause`, `withdraw`) can only be called by the contract owner.
    - Such calls from non-owner accounts revert with `OwnableUnauthorizedAccount`.
- **Pausable Functionality (`Pausable`):**
    - Owner can pause and unpause tipping functionality.
    - Tipping attempts (via `tip()` or `receive()`) revert with `EnforcedPause` when the contract is paused.
- **Royalties (`ERC2981`):**
    - Correct retrieval of default royalty information using `royaltyInfo()`.
    - Owner can update royalty settings (receiver and fee numerator) via `setRoyalty()`.
    - `royaltyInfo()` reflects updated royalty settings accurately.
- **Withdrawals:**
    - Owner can successfully withdraw the entire contract ETH balance.
    - Withdrawals to the zero address are rejected (expecting `ZeroAddress` error).
    - Attempted withdrawals when the contract balance is zero revert (expecting `WithdrawFailed` error).
- **Reentrancy Protection (`ReentrancyGuard`):**
    - The `Reentrancy.test.js` file uses an attacker contract (`Reenter.sol`) to specifically test that the `tip()` function (and by extension `_processTip` and `receive`) is protected against reentrancy attacks, expecting a `ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall` error.

This thorough testing approach aims to provide high confidence in the contract's behavior under various conditions, contributing significantly to the quality assurance of the project.

### 4.3. Deployment
The deployment process is managed by the [`scripts/deploy.js`](TipNFT/scripts/deploy.js:0) Hardhat script.

1.  **Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured** with your `PRIVATE_KEY` and the `RPC_URL` for the desired network (e.g., `sepolia` as configured in [`hardhat.config.js`](TipNFT/hardhat.config.js:0)).
2.  The deployment script allows overriding default tier thresholds using `TIER1_THRESHOLD` and `TIER2_THRESHOLD` environment variables. If not set, it uses predefined defaults (0.01 ETH for Tier 1, 0.05 ETH for Tier 2).
3.  **Deploy the contract using Hardhat:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network_name>
    ```
    Replace `<your_network_name>` with the network name defined in [`hardhat.config.js`](TipNFT/hardhat.config.js:0) (e.g., `sepolia`).

    **Example for Sepolia testnet:**
    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
    ```
    The script will output the deployed contract address, transaction hash, and other relevant information. If an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is provided in `.env` and the deployment is to a supported public network (like Sepolia or Mainnet), the script will also attempt to automatically verify the contract on Etherscan.

## 6. Smart Contract: `TipNFT.sol`

The [`TipNFT.sol`](TipNFT/contracts/TipNFT.sol:0) contract is the heart of the project, handling the logic for tipping, NFT minting, and associated functionalities.

### 5.1. Inherited OpenZeppelin Contracts
`TipNFT.sol` leverages several battle-tested contracts from OpenZeppelin for standard features and security:
-   **`ERC721Enumerable.sol`**: Extends the base `ERC721` NFT standard to provide on-chain enumeration of tokens owned by an address and of all tokens within the contract. This is crucial for dApps and services that need to query token ownership or list all tokens without relying solely on off-chain indexing for basic use cases.
-   **`Ownable.sol`**: Implements a basic access control mechanism, granting an "owner" account exclusive permission to execute certain administrative functions.
-   **`Pausable.sol`**: Provides functionality for the contract owner to pause and unpause critical operations (specifically, tipping via `tip()` and `receive()`) in case of emergencies or maintenance.
-   **`ReentrancyGuard.sol`**: Offers protection against reentrancy attacks by providing the `nonReentrant` modifier, which is applied to sensitive functions like `tip()`, `receive()`, and `withdraw()`.
-   **`ERC2981.sol`**: Implements the EIP-2981 NFT Royalty Standard, allowing for standardized on-chain retrieval of royalty payment information for marketplaces and other platforms.

### 5.2. Core Logic and Key Features

#### 5.2.1. NFT Tiers
-   NFTs are minted into one of three tiers: `Tier.Tier1`, `Tier.Tier2`, or `Tier.Tier3`.
-   The tier is determined by the `msg.value` (amount of ETH sent with the transaction) compared against two configurable thresholds: `tier1Threshold` and `tier2Threshold`.
    -   Tip <= `tier1Threshold`: Mints a Tier 1 NFT.
    -   Tip > `tier1Threshold` AND Tip <= `tier2Threshold`: Mints a Tier 2 NFT.
    -   Tip > `tier2Threshold`: Mints a Tier 3 NFT.
-   The `Tier` is an `enum` defined within the contract. `Tier.None` is an unused member.

#### 5.2.2. Minting Process (`tip()` and `receive()`)
Users can mint an NFT in two ways:
1.  **Explicitly via `tip()`**: Calling the `payable` function `tip()` with an ETH payment.
2.  **Implicitly via `receive()`**: Sending ETH directly to the contract address triggers the `payable` `receive()` fallback function.

Both methods invoke the internal `_processTip()` function.

**Minting Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User sends ETH via tip() or receive()] --> B{Amount > 0?};
    B -- Yes --> C{Contract Paused?};
    B -- No --> X1[Revert NoTipSent];
    C -- No --> D{Reentrancy Check};
    C -- Yes --> X2[Revert EnforcedPause];
    D -- Pass --> E{Determine Tier based on Amount};
    E --> F[Tier1: Amount <= tier1Threshold];
    E --> G[Tier2: Amount > tier1Threshold AND <= tier2Threshold];
    E --> H[Tier3: Amount > tier2Threshold];
    F --> I{Mint NFT (Token ID, Tier 1)};
    G --> I;
    H --> I;
    I --> J[Assign tokenTier mapping];
    J --> K[Update totalTips for sender];
    K --> L[Emit Tip Event];
    D -- Fail --> X3[Revert ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall];
```

**Details of `_processTip(address sender, uint256 amount)`:**
-   Ensures `amount` is greater than zero (reverts with `NoTipSent` otherwise).
-   Determines the `Tier` based on `amount` and the defined thresholds.
-   Assigns the next available `tokenId` (sequentially, starting from 0, managed by `_currentTokenId`).
-   Increments `_currentTokenId`.
-   Maps the `tokenId` to its `Tier` in the `tokenTier` mapping.
-   Increments the `totalTips` for the `sender`.
-   Mints the NFT to the `sender` using `_safeMint(sender, tokenId)`.
-   Emits a `Tip` event with details of the mint.

Both `tip()` and `receive()` are `payable`, `whenNotPaused` (from `Pausable`), and `nonReentrant` (from `ReentrancyGuard`).

#### 5.2.3. Token ID Management
-   A private counter `_currentTokenId` is used to assign sequential token IDs, starting from 0 for the first minted token.
-   The `ERC721Enumerable` extension automatically handles the tracking and enumeration of minted tokens.

#### 5.2.4. Metadata (`tokenURI()` and `setBaseURI()`)
-   **`tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`**: A `public view` function that returns the metadata URI for a given `tokenId`.
    -   It first checks if the token exists by calling `ownerOf(tokenId)` (which reverts if the token doesn't exist).
    -   It retrieves the `Tier` for the `tokenId` from the `tokenTier` mapping.
    -   It constructs the final URI by appending the `tokenId` (converted to a string) to the `baseURI` set for that specific `Tier`.
    -   If no `baseURI` is set for the token's tier, it returns an empty string, adhering to ERC721 specifications for optional metadata.
-   **`setBaseURI(Tier tier, string calldata uri)`**: An `onlyOwner` function allowing the contract owner to set the base URI string for each `Tier` (Tier1, Tier2, Tier3). Emits a `BaseURISet` event.

#### 5.2.5. Token Ownership Enumeration (`getOwnedTokens()`)
-   **`getOwnedTokens(address owner_)`**: An `external view` function that returns an array of `uint256` token IDs owned by the specified `owner_`.
-   This function leverages `ERC721Enumerable`'s `balanceOf()` and `tokenOfOwnerByIndex()` for efficient on-chain enumeration without requiring manual tracking arrays, which can become gas-intensive.

#### 5.2.6. Total Supply (`totalSupply()`)
-   **`totalSupply()`**: A `public view` function, overriding the one from `ERC721Enumerable`, which returns the total number of NFTs minted so far.

#### 5.2.7. Royalties (`setRoyalty()` and `royaltyInfo()`)
-   The contract implements `ERC2981` for standardized on-chain royalty information.
-   **`_setDefaultRoyalty(receiver, feeNumerator)`**: Called in the constructor to set initial default royalty (e.g., 5% to the `initialOwner`).
-   **`setRoyalty(address receiver, uint96 feeNumerator)`**: An `onlyOwner` function to update the default royalty receiver address and the fee numerator (e.g., 500 for a 5% royalty fee). Emits a `RoyaltyUpdated` event.
-   **`royaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice)`**: A `public view` function (as per `ERC2981`) that returns the royalty `receiver` address and the `royaltyAmount` for a given `tokenId` (though in this implementation, royalties are contract-wide, not token-specific) and `salePrice`.

#### 5.2.8. Tier Threshold Management (`setTierThresholds()`)
-   **`setTierThresholds(uint256 tier1, uint256 tier2)`**: An `onlyOwner` function to update the ETH thresholds that define `Tier1` and `Tier2`. Ensures `tier1 > 0` and `tier1 < tier2`. Emits a `ThresholdsUpdated` event.

#### 5.2.9. ETH Withdrawals (`withdraw()`)
-   **`withdraw(address payable to)`**: An `onlyOwner` and `nonReentrant` function that allows the contract owner to withdraw the entire ETH balance accumulated in the contract to a specified address `to`.
-   Reverts if `to` is the zero address or if the withdrawal call fails. Emits a `Withdraw` event.

#### 5.2.10. Pausing Contract (`pause()` and `unpause()`)
-   **`pause()`**: An `onlyOwner` function that pauses the tipping functionality (i.e., calls to `tip()` and `receive()` will revert).
-   **`unpause()`**: An `onlyOwner` function that resumes the tipping functionality.

### 5.3. Events
The contract emits events for significant actions to facilitate off-chain tracking and UI updates:
-   `Tip(address indexed donor, uint8 tier, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when an NFT is successfully minted via `_processTip`.
-   `BaseURISet(uint8 tier, string uri)`: Emitted when a base URI for a specific tier is set or updated by the owner.
-   `Withdraw(address indexed to, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when the owner successfully withdraws funds from the contract.
-   `ThresholdsUpdated(uint256 tier1, uint256 tier2)`: Emitted when the tier thresholds are updated by the owner.
-   `Received(address indexed from, uint256 amount)`: Emitted specifically when ETH is received via the `receive()` fallback function.
-   `RoyaltyUpdated(address receiver, uint96 feeNumerator)`: Emitted when the default royalty settings are updated by the owner.
-   Standard `ERC721` events (e.g., `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`) are also emitted by the underlying `ERC721Enumerable` contract upon minting and transfers.
-   Standard `Ownable`, `Pausable`, and `ERC2981` events are also emitted by their respective parent contracts.

### 5.4. Custom Errors
To provide more gas-efficient and descriptive error reporting compared to string-based `require` messages, the contract utilizes custom errors:
-   `NoTipSent()`: If `msg.value` is zero during a tipping attempt.
-   `InvalidTier()`: If an operation involves an invalid or unassigned tier (e.g., `Tier.None` in `setBaseURI` or `tokenURI` logic).
-   `ZeroAddress()`: If an operation requiring a non-zero address (like withdrawal recipient or royalty receiver) is given `address(0)`.
-   `InvalidThresholds()`: If `setTierThresholds` is called with `tier1 == 0` or `tier1 >= tier2`.
-   `WithdrawFailed()`: If the ETH transfer during withdrawal fails or if the contract balance is zero.
-   Standard OpenZeppelin errors like `OwnableUnauthorizedAccount`, `EnforcedPause` (from `Pausable`), `ERC721NonexistentToken`, and `ERC721OutOfBoundsIndex` (from `ERC721Enumerable`) are also used implicitly or explicitly by the inherited contracts.

## 7. Security Considerations

Security is a paramount concern in smart contract development. TipNFT incorporates several measures and follows best practices:

-   **Reentrancy Protection**: The `tip()`, `receive()`, and `withdraw()` functions are protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard.sol`. This prevents malicious contracts from making reentrant calls to exploit these functions. This is explicitly tested in `test/Reentrancy.test.js`.
-   **Access Control**: The `Ownable.sol` pattern is used to restrict sensitive administrative functions (e.g., `setBaseURI`, `setTierThresholds`, `setRoyalty`, `pause`, `unpause`, `withdraw`) to the designated contract owner.
-   **Integer Overflows/Underflows**: The contract is written using Solidity `^0.8.20`, which includes default checked arithmetic, mitigating risks of integer overflows and underflows for most operations.
-   **Gas Limits and Potential DoS**:
    -   While `ERC721Enumerable` improves on-chain enumeration capabilities, operations involving iteration over tokens (like `getOwnedTokens`, which iterates based on an owner's balance) can still be gas-intensive if an account owns a very large number of NFTs. This is a known trade-off of `ERC721Enumerable`. For dApps requiring extensive querying of large datasets, relying on off-chain indexing of emitted events is often a more scalable approach.
-   **External Calls**: The `withdraw()` function makes an external call (`to.call{value: bal}("")`). This is done after all state changes and uses the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Combined with `nonReentrant`, this minimizes risks associated with external calls.
-   **Use of Battle-Tested Libraries**: Relying on OpenZeppelin Contracts for common functionalities like ERC721, Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, and ERC2981 significantly enhances security by using audited and widely trusted code.
-   **Trust Assumptions**: Users interacting with the contract trust the owner not to misuse administrative privileges, such as pausing the contract indefinitely, setting unreasonable royalty fees, or maliciously managing withdrawn funds (though funds are typically from tips intended for the project/owner). These are common trust assumptions in centrally-owned utility contracts.

**Disclaimer:** While efforts have been made to ensure the security of this contract, **it is strongly recommended to conduct a professional, independent security audit before deploying this contract to a mainnet environment with real funds.** This documentation does not constitute an audit.

## 8. Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas)

The current TipNFT contract serves as a robust foundation. Potential future enhancements could include:

-   **Signature Minting (EIP-712)**: Allow users to mint NFTs based on an off-chain signature provided by the owner or an authorized account. This can save users gas on the minting transaction itself, as another party could submit it.
-   **Batch Minting**: Implement functionality for users or the owner to mint multiple NFTs in a single transaction, potentially reducing overall gas costs for multiple mints.
-   **More Complex Tier Logic**: Introduce more dynamic or configurable tier determination mechanisms, possibly based on factors beyond simple ETH thresholds.
-   **Off-Chain Metadata Storage Integration**: Facilitate storing NFT metadata on decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, with only the hash or URI stored on-chain, further decentralizing metadata.
-   **Upgradability**: Implement an upgrade pattern (e.g., UUPS proxies via OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugins) if significant future contract logic changes are anticipated without requiring a full data migration.
-   **Token-Specific Royalties**: Extend `ERC2981` to allow different royalty settings per individual token ID, if required by the use case.
-   **Time-Limited Tiers or Campaigns**: Introduce a mechanism for special, time-limited tipping campaigns or tiers.
